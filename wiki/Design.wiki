The application will have five(maybe more or less) screens:
  * Main Page, loaded when app is open.
       * Button to Connect OBD-II Bluetooth Device
  * Live Data ( Possibly with visual Gauges for some data like rpm speed and temp)
  * Diagnostic Trouble Codes(DTC) Look up and deletion
  * Freeze Frame Data (A snap shot of data when a emission-related diagnostic trouble code occurs)<br>
